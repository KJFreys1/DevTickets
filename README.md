# DevTickets

DevTickets is a free web application intended to help development teams communicate issues and track bugs on projects. It uses the MERN stack with Auth0 for security and Socket.io to update users on updates in real-time. Each component on the front end and controller on the back end will be tested thoroughly prior to release, and the application will be mobile-friendly.

This is currently a work in progress with an estimated "release" date of August 4th this year.
